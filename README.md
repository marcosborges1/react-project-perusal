# Perusal Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
This is my custom design that serves as an achievement to complete the second course module.


## Information about this project

This project is a simple page that shows posts in categories based on React-Redux. These posts can be added, viewed, edited, deleted. Posts may also have comments, which can also be edited, deleted, and so on.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
